Problem Statement:
Create an App for Job Portal System which will allow Job Seeker /Employee to search for jobs. Nowadays Job portal sites/apps have got huge importance as we can’t apply for the jobs physically due to pandemic. This system is recruiter as well as applicant friendly as it has overcome many disadvantages of the old Job Portal System.

Objectives:
The main objective of this system is to provide the information about new jobs. This app can help any Fresher/Employee to search for any job available. Employers/ Companies can post the job details like Position, Description, CTC offered, etc and can track the number of applicants applied and view their resumes. They can recruit employees from a number of applicants based on their skills.
